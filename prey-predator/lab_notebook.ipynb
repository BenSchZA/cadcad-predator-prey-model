    "\n",
    "We explored here two different paradigms for modelling: the dynamic system one, which captures an macroscopical view of the system, and the agent-based one, which can give us an microscopic view of the system. Depending on the targets and considerations, both can be equivalent or completely distinct, but can also be complementary. cadCAD allows you to mix them at will, so you can have hybrid models where agent behaviour and environment are shaped by complex dynamical systems. There is an whole multiverse of mixed simulations that you can do (challenges on next block for you to try!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, both paradigms have some characteristics, which in general manner we can express as being:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamical system (macroscopic view) advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast-performing, allowing a very large number of timesteps and simulations\n",
    "* Easier to prototype and to add/modify mechanisms\n",
    "* Easier to insert a multitude of complex factors\n",
    "* The output is usually easy to visualize\n",
    "* Inner workings are more transparent\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent-based modelling (microscopic view) advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are conceptually closer to experience, making it easier to explain to someone with no previous background\n",
    "<!---* There is more allowance on stochastic mechanisms and logic--->\n",
    "* Easier to generate complex behaviour with simple rules\n",
    "* Generates more granular and detailed information\n",
    "* Inner workings have more depth\n"

    "### Proposed challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Find the equivalent models\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cadCAD's support for Monte Carlo simulations and parameter sweeping to find a set of parameters that, in expectation, results in nearly equivalent results for the populations of preys and predators over time in both models. You'll need to run multiple Monte Carlo runs of the ABM model and aggregate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sazonability of food growth\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick way to mix the ABM and SD paradigms is the following: what if the food growth depends on an dynamical system? \n",
    "\n",
    "You can model that by modifying the food growth policy, such as by inserting a sazonability which depends on the timestep for example. Or you could go even further and try to express it as depending on an irradiance-based dynamical system which models the Sun position according to Earth's movements (rotation, translation, recession and nutation). How much do you think that those layers of additional complexity will add to the knowledge behind the physical system which we are modelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochasticity of the agents decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current model, all randomness is derived from the agents' position on the grid relative to other agents. What if there was also some probability $p_i$ associated with each one of the actions (moving, eating, reproducing)? And what if the decision also depended on the state of the system near the agent, such as the presence of a predator and food availability?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent death by exponential probability\n",
    "\n",
    "All agents die when the maximum lifespan arrives. Can you modify the ABM for having an associated spontaneous death probability according to exponential distribution? Something which makes almost all young agents live, but most old ones to die? What if this probability is also a function of an indicator of the agent's health, such as the amount of food in their stomach?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prey evolution & adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the master challenge :-)  What if the preys had a varying attribute which gave them some competitive advantage over others? For example, a number of lifes, like in a videogame, or speed, reproduction rate, or different lifespans? What if those attributes were passed on their offspring with some mutation probability? Could we see an initial random population of preys evolve into a stronger set?"
